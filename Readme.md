Micro-Controller Pianola
===================
Micro-Controller Pianola is an open source software that runs a PIC16F1825 microcontroller as a pianola.
The micro-controller must have 7 metal piece attached (each of them in one capacitive sensor port) as key.

Compiling
---------
Import the project in MPLAbX IDE and you can run and/or download the software on the micro-controller.
The compiler used was XC, available at microchip internet page.

User guide
----------
Once you have download the software on the microcontroller with MPLabX IDE, you are able to play music by pressing the metal pins attached (on the cps input of the microcontroller).
Compatibility
-------------
The software has been tested **only** on PIC16F1825, but it would be able to runs in different micro-controller belonging to the same product family, with almost seven cps input and compatible hardware setting, like clock and timer.
Known bugs
---------
Nothing at the moment of writing.
